--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into. Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table. Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT distinct artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 
SELECT avg(danceability), track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name, popularity
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What is the average popularity, danceability and energy by artist and track? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Which artists had more than 1 song on the top 50 chart?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS numberofsongsontop50 FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING numberofsongsontop50 > 1
ORDER BY numberofsongsontop50 DESC;

--What is the correlation between tempo and song popularity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, tempo, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) DESC;
--Based on this data, it does not look like there is a correlation between tempo and song popularity.


--Is it a bop or a flop (Query using a CASE statement)?
SELECT track_name,
CASE
WHEN energy > .64 AND danceability > .68 THEN "BOP!"
WHEN energy > .44 AND danceability > .50 THEN "Eh Not Bad"
ELSE "FLOP"
END AS "BopOrFlop"
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY BopOrFlop ASC;


--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
--(Using a CTE)

WITH avg_popularity_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS Tag
FROM avg_popularity_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
