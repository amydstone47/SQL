--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into. Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT distinct artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 
SELECT avg(danceability), track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name, popularity
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What is the average popularity, danceability and energy by artist and track? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Which artists had more than 1 song on the top 50 chart?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS numberofsongsontop50 FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING numberofsongsontop50 > 1
ORDER BY numberofsongsontop50 DESC;

--What is the correlation between tempo and song popularity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, tempo, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) DESC;
--Based on this data, it does not look like there is a correlation between tempo and song popularity.


--Is it a bop or a flop (Query using a CASE statement)?
SELECT track_name,
CASE
WHEN energy > .64 AND danceability > .68 THEN "BOP!"
WHEN energy > .44 AND danceability > .50 THEN "Eh Not Bad"
ELSE "FLOP"
